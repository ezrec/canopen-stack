# CANopen Stack Project Website

This branch contains the project website, powered by *Jekyll* (with the *TeXt Theme*) and hosted by *GitHub Pages*.

When you want to develop within the jekyll environment to change configuration or enhance theme adjustments, you need to:
- install Jekyll on your local machine
- checkout this branch
- call `bundle update` to install all ruby packages
- call `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build and run a local webserver for testing

For small changes in the website, it may be sufficient to work only with the related markdown file:
- checkout this branch
- change the markdown file(s)
- push your changes
- wait until GitHub rebuilds the website

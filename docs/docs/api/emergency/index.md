  This area describes the API functions of the emergency module. These functions are implemented within the source file: `co_emcy.c/h`

  <!--more-->

  The class CO_EMCY is defined within co_emcy.h and is responsible for the emergency management functions. The following data members are in this class:

  | Data Member | Type | Description |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | Node | `CO_NODE *` | pointer to parent node |
  | Root | `CO_EMCY_TBL *` | pointer to application emergency table |
  | Hist | `CO_EMCY_HIST` | emergency history management object |
  | Cnt[] | `uint8_t` | error register object entry bit counters |
  | Err[] | `uint8_t` | individual emergency status storage |

  Note: The data within this structure must never be manipulated without the corresponding class member   functions. This can lead to unpredictable behavior of the node.

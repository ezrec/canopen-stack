This function waits for a CAN frame on the interface without timeout.

<!--more-->

### Description

If a CAN frame is received, the given receive frame buffer will be filled with the received data. The read function is rarely used from within the application, because the CANopen will receive all messages by default and allows to work on all non-CANopen messages with a callback function.

#### Prototype

```c
int16_t COIfRead(CO_IF *cif, CO_IF_FRM *frm);
```

#### Arguments

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| cif | pointer to interface object |
| frm | pointer to destination frame buffer |

#### Returned Value

- `>0` : size of `CO_IF_FRM` on success
- `<0` : an error is detected

### Example

If necessary, the following example show how to call the blocking receive function for the interface of the CANopen node AppNode:

```c
    CO_IF_FRM  frame;
    int16_t    err;
    :
    err = COIfRead (&(AppNode.If), &frame);
    if (err < 0) {
        /* error in interface layer */
    } else {
        /* frame contains received data */
    }
    :
```
